  "Thin subprocess wrapper around the official `b2` CLI
  (https://github.com/Backblaze/B2_Command_Line_Tool) — no B2/S3 signing is
  reimplemented here, per this workspace's \"consume existing infra, don't
  rebuild it\" convention.

  Every call passes credentials via `B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID` /
  `B2_APPLICATION_KEY` environment variables scoped to that single
  subprocess invocation only (this is the `b2` CLI's own documented
  env-var auth flow). It never calls `b2 account authorize`, which persists
  to `~/.b2_account_info` as global mutable state and was the exact
  mechanism that leaked a scoped key into a chat transcript in the session
  that motivated this repo (ADR-2607152322) — per-call env vars avoid both
  the persistent side effect and any cross-bucket session bleed between
  concurrent tool calls.

  Every public fn's result is passed through com-backblaze-secure.redact
  before returning — callers (com-backblaze-secure.server) must not bypass
  these fns to shell out to `b2` directly."
