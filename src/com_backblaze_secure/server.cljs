(ns com-backblaze-secure.server
  "MCP stdio entrypoint for the Backblaze B2 secure MCP server
  (ADR-2607152322). Wires `kotoba-lang/mcp` (mcp-clj — portable manifest +
  pure JSON-RPC dispatcher, `:local/root` dependency, no third-party runtime
  deps) to two things this repo is actually responsible for:

  1. the MCP stdio wire transport (newline-delimited JSON — the current
     MCP stdio transport spec, not LSP-style Content-Length framing), the
     one host-injected port mcp-clj's own README says a host must supply;
  2. an `mcp.ports/ITool` whose `invoke` ALWAYS checks
     com-backblaze-secure.config's bucket/capability allowlist before
     calling com-backblaze-secure.b2-cli, and ALWAYS appends a redacted
     entry to com-backblaze-secure.audit afterwards.

  No tool response and no audit-log line ever contains raw credential
  material — see com-backblaze-secure.redact, which every b2-cli return
  value passes through before it reaches this namespace."
